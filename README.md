# Multi-Variable-Linear-Equation-Solver
The aim of this project is to find the value of different variables if a set of equations are given. This project is based upon the method of solving multi-variable equations using determinants and employs Cramer's Rule. This project is heavily dependent on recursion.
The classes methods and variables of the code are all well documented in comments throughout the code. (The main method of this project is located in the class Equation)
